Have you ever wondered, “why does growth in tech feel _really_ hard“?

I asked myself this exact question about 3 years ago in 2022. After I [started my tech career](/blog/how-i-became-a-programmer), I realized I wasn't really growing (at least not fast enough) compared to how much I was learning. I knew a couple of things in theory, but in practice? My skills were still super mid.

But now I’ve come to realize—everybody wants to grow too fast.

We want results with little patience. We binge tutorials, clone projects, follow gurus, yet it doesn’t translate into actual growth. We mistake consumption for progress. I was there too.

And the truth is this: **growth isn't about doing something right once, it's about doing the right thing consistently**. Not for a week, or a month. But **forever**.

Let’s break this down.

## Developer Growth Pyramid

There’s a framework I call the **Developer Growth Pyramid**. Think of it like a mental model for leveling up. Most devs stay stuck at the bottom layers because they skip the foundation and try to jump straight to the advanced stuff.

### 1. Foundation (Mindset Upgrade)

Before you write one more line of code, fix your mindset.

- **Learn how to learn**: This means knowing how to read documentation, debug issues, search smarter, and retain knowledge over time.
- **Unlearn YouTube & AI Dependency**: Stop depending on videos or AI. Learn to figure things out on your own.
- **Build problem-solving habits**: If your first instinct is to copy-paste code or ask for help, you're not training your mind to think.
- **Patience + Curiosity**: Tech will frustrate you. Be okay with confusion. Be obsessed with figuring stuff out.

### 2. Core Skills (Your Base Stack)

Stop trying to be a generalist early on. Choose a direction and focus on that.

- If you love the web, pick **frontend**, **backend**, or **fullstack**—but only one at first.
- If you're into apps, pick **mobile dev** with Flutter or React Native.
- Into gaming? Try Unity or Godot.

The earlier you niche down, the faster you'll grow.

And within that, master:

- One language (e.g., JavaScript, Golang, Python)
- One tool for version control (Git)
- One database
- One framework

Become predictable and solid in your base stack. Don’t switch stacks every 3 months.

### 3. Tooling & Frameworks

This is where things start to get spicy.

- Learn how to use your tools, not just _what_ they do.
- Don’t just learn [Next.js](/blog/you-should-be-using-nextjs)—understand why it exists, and what problems it solves.
- Understand Postgres instead of just installing Prisma or Drizzle.

Real growth happens when tools stop being magical and start feeling like extensions of your brain.

## Product Thinking: Code That Matters

Let’s be real—no one cares how pretty your code is if your app is pointless.

Good devs think like users.

- **Who is this for?**
- **What problem does it solve?**
- **Why would someone care to use it?**

If you want to stand out, stop building what other devs are building. Build what actual users will love. Think like a designer and a founder, not just a coder.

---

## Communication: The Cheat Code

Most devs ignore this, but the ability to communicate your thoughts is what levels you up fast.

- Can you explain your code to a junior?
- Can you write a README that someone else can understand? (use [Dokugen](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dokugen) for AI generated READMEs btw)
- Can you ask clear, thoughtful questions when stuck?

Writing and speaking well opens doors. It also shows clarity of thought—and clarity is rare.

## What Slows You Down

Let’s talk about the real blockers.

### 1. Tutorial Hell

You feel productive watching videos. But you’re just watching. Not learning. Not building.

### 2. Fear of Shipping

You want your project to be perfect before showing it. That perfectionism will kill your growth. Ship it messy.

### 3. Building [Useless Projects](/blog/what-you-should-build)

The world doesn’t need your 50th to-do list app. Build stuff that solves _real_ pain.

### 4. Chasing Hype

Today it’s Astro. Tomorrow it’s Bun. Focus. New tools will keep coming. Learn concepts, not just syntax.

### 5. AI Overuse

Yes, ChatGPT can write your code. But if you rely on it for everything, you’re not learning—you’re outsourcing your thinking to something _dumb._

### 6. Learning Everything At Once

Pick one lane and double down. You can learn other stacks later.

## What Actually Works

Let’s flip the table. Here's how real devs grow:

- **Build Projects That Solve Real Problems**: Your friend needs a portfolio site? Build it. Your sibling needs a finance tracker? Build it.
- **Teach What You Learn**: Blog, tweet, record short videos. Teaching forces you to understand deeply.
- **Work With Others**: Join small projects. Contribute to open source. Collaborate.
- **Ask for Feedback**: Share your code. Let people roast it. Then fix it.
- **Master Debugging**: Learn how to read error logs. Use console.log with purpose. Know how to trace issues. Debugging is your superpower.

## Don’t Be a Solo Dev Forever

We get it. You're an introvert. But growth happens faster in community.

- Join a dev Discord.
- Tweet your progress.
- Find a learning buddy. (bonus points if they’re cute and your opposite gender 👀)
- Go to hackathons or tech events.

Being around driven people rubs off. Energy is contagious.

## Track Your Growth

If you don’t track, you’ll feel like you’re not moving.

- Write weekly logs: What did I learn? What confused me? What did I build?
- Monthly review: What improved? What didn’t?
- Public goals: Share them on X. Let people hold you accountable.
- Get a coach or senior dev to guide you.

Growth becomes real when you see it on paper.

## Tech Is Fast. You Don’t Have to Be.

This is the part nobody says out loud.

You don’t have to learn everything.

- You don’t need to know 12 JS frameworks.
- You don’t need to build the next Facebook.
- You don’t need to code 12 hours a day.

What you need is **consistency**, and **curiosity**.

The devs who go far aren’t the fastest. They’re the most intentional.

## Conclusion

Growth in tech isn’t about magic formulas or overnight success. It’s the small, smart moves done over and over.

- Fix your foundation.
- Pick a stack.
- Build real things.
- Teach.
- Join a community.
- Track your journey.

Do this for 7 months straight, and I promise—you won’t recognize yourself.

Pick one or two things from this blog and start doing them today.

And if this helped? Share it with a dev who’s feeling stuck.

See you at the top.
