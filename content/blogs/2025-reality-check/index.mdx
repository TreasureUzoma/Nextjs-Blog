It's hard to believe, but here we are — it's already March 22nd, 2025, and I still haven’t built anything truly **portfolio-worthy** just yet. It’s a bit surprising when I reflect on how last year was all about shipping multiple projects and constantly improving my skills. 

That said, I’ve come to the realization that relentlessly pushing myself to build without taking the time to reflect and grow might not always be the best approach — at least not for me personally. If you’re in the same boat, I would highly recommend taking the time to pause, reflect, and allow yourself space to grow. **2025**, however, will definitely be an exciting year ahead for me.

This intentional break has provided me with the time to brainstorm and come up with not only ideas for **portfolio-worthy** projects but also some concepts that I believe have the potential to evolve into impactful **startups** with the ability to make a positive difference in the world.

In addition to brainstorming, I’ve spent the past few months diving into new technologies, doing tons of tech-based research, and — perhaps most importantly — improving my circle of friends and collaborators. These are all vital aspects of personal and professional growth that I’m very proud of.

### Building Something New: SupaMetrics

At the moment, a few close friends and I are actively working on an exciting new project — [SupaMetrics](https://github.com/supametrics), which is a privacy-focused analytics solution tailored for websites and apps. We are also developing an open-source link shortener to complement the tool. 

Our mission with SupaMetrics is to create a seamless experience for developers by offering simple integration with all modern frameworks and tools, including [React.js](https://react.dev), Vue, and even [CMS](https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/content-management-system/) platforms like [WordPress](https://wordpress.com), [Shopify](https://shopify.com), and many others.


Here's a quick look at how you can integrate SupaMetrics with Next.js:

```tsx
// layout.tsx
import { Analytics } from "supametrics";

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <Analytics client="your-tracking-id"/>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

## This is just the beginning

The journey has only just begun, and what lies ahead is greatness. I have a multitude of ideas and projects I plan to build in the coming months, which I will share with you soon. Stay tuned — there's so much more to come!

## Conclusion 

That’s all for now. Not much else to say except that you should definitely expect big things from me in the months ahead. I’m excited to see where this year will take me and to continue sharing my journey with you all.
