So you’re a **developer**, most likely a **frontend developer**, and you’re thinking: “Do I need to learn **Next.js**?” “Isn’t **React.js** enough?” Or maybe you’re just curious and hoping to learn something new. If so, this blog is for you.

**Caution**: I’m not writing out of bias, even though I’m tagged as a Next.js fanboy. I’m just giving my honest reasons.  

Firstly, **Next.js** is a **React.js framework**. It fixes things React overlooked or never cared to fix. It has a ton of features React.js will likely never have. Plus, it has **fullstack capabilities**, allowing you to create fullstack apps with **server actions and API routes**. More on this later.  

With the latest update, you can now create a Next.js app **with only API routes** using the `--api` flag during installation. It also comes with **Node.js middlewares** (currently experimental at the time of writing this blog), proving that Next.js is pushing hard to improve its backend features.  

But then, why should you even learn or build with Next.js when you can get better performance with Reactjs +  Express.js? Let’s dive in.

## Why React.js Alone Isn’t Enough  

As I said earlier, **React.js is just incomplete**.  

Think about it—there’s a reason we learned TypeScript: **JavaScript shipped without type safety**, making it too loose. React.js solved JavaScript issues by introducing things like **faster routing, the virtual DOM, and a structured component-based approach**. (Check out React’s full list of features [here](https://react.dev).)  

But when it comes to **building modern, fast, scalable applications**, React alone isn’t enough. You’d still need a framework to handle things like:  

- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** for better performance  
- **Code splitting** to load only what’s needed  
- **Faster reloading and seamless transitions**  

That’s where **Next.js** comes in. Other React frameworks like **Remix and Gatsby** also try to solve these issues, but Next.js simply does it best.

## Routing in Next.js  

While Next.js’ app router has been controversial, **routing in Next.js is much simpler and more intuitive** than React Router.  

Next.js uses **file-based routing**, meaning your folder structure defines your routes. No need to manually set up a routing system—it’s all automatic.  

Compare this to React Router, which **changes syntax every other full moon**. Every update seems to break something. With Next.js, routing stays clean, predictable, and easy to maintain.

## Native Support for TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and ESLint  

Setting up a **React.js project from scratch** is honestly a pain.  

- You need **Webpack** (or Vite).  
- You need to manually add **Tailwind support**.  
- You need manually add **Eslint**.  
- You have to install **React Router** for navigation.  

**With Next.js, all of these are built-in** (or require just a single command). You save hours of setup time and can **start coding immediately**.

## Why You Need a React Framework in 2025  

If you’re still skeptical about using a framework, let’s be real:  

**The industry has moved forward.**  

- Most big companies **don’t build plain React apps anymore**—they use frameworks like Next.js.  
- Hiring managers expect you to know at least one React framework.  
- Modern development is **not just about UI**—it’s about performance, scalability, and DX (Developer Experience).  

If you still don’t see why you need a framework in 2025, you’re beyond redemption. 😭  

Now, for those of you who get it, the real argument **isn’t whether to use a framework—it’s which one is best**.

## Next.js vs. Remix vs. Gatsby  

Before we even compare, you should know: **Vercel (the company behind Next.js) actually hires top-tier developers to improve it**. That means **faster updates, better support, and more cutting-edge features**.  

| Feature           | Next.js | Remix | Gatsby |
|------------------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Performance** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **SSR Support** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Static Site Generation (SSG)** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **API Routes** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Built-in Middleware** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Best for SEO** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Developer Experience** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Company Support** | Vercel (Strong) | Shopify (New) | Netlify (Limited) |

Looking at this, **Next.js is clearly the best option**. 😏

## Next.js is a Fullstack Framework  

This is another area where **React purists** start crying.  

With **Next.js, you can:**
- Create **secure API routes**  
- Use **server actions** to execute backend logic  
- Manage **cookies, authentication, and session storage**  
- Deploy fullstack apps **without needing a separate backend**  

If you’re a frontend developer wanting to build **simple but secure fullstack apps**, **Next.js is perfect**.  

For example, you can:  
- Use **NextAuth.js** for authentication  
- Use **PostgreSQL or Prisma** as a database  
- Deploy easily on **Vercel**

## More Reasons to Use Next.js  

- **Massive community support** → Tons of tutorials, plugins, and open-source packages.  
- **Scalability** → Whether you’re building a personal blog or an enterprise app, Next.js can handle it.  
- **Edge computing** → Leverage **serverless functions and edge deployments** for insane performance.  

It’s honestly a no-brainer.

## How to Get Started with Next.js  

By now, you’re probably convinced that Next.js is the way to go. So, how do you start?  

- Read the official **[Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)**  
- Watch **JavaScript Mastery’s Next.js tutorials** on YouTube  
- **Build projects every week**—practice is key!

## Conclusion  

Next.js isn’t just another framework—it’s the **best way to build React apps** in 2025.  

If you’re a React developer, **learning Next.js isn’t optional anymore—it’s a necessity**.  

The faster you start, the better your projects (and job prospects) will be.  

**See you in the Next.js world!** 🚀
